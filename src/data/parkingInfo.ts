/**
 * Each resort's own published parking structure — researched via web search
 * against the resort's own site or, where the resort itself doesn't publish
 * a dedicated parking page, a clearly-credited town/transportation-authority
 * page (e.g. Breckenridge's parking is run by the Town of Breckenridge, not
 * the resort). Researched September 2026, for the 2025-26 season's published
 * rules unless a 2026-27 change was already announced (noted per entry) —
 * treat as a strong starting point, not self-updating; a human should
 * spot-check before relying on it for a specific date.
 *
 * `status` is always `'unknown'` here: none of these sources expose live
 * per-lot occupancy publicly. See `domain/parking.ts` and
 * `providers/live/parking.ts` for why that is honest rather than a gap to
 * paper over.
