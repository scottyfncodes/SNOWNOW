/**
 * Researched from each resort's own public pages/press materials via web
 * search (see per-entry `notes`). This sandbox's outbound web access is
 * restricted the same way the CDOT/Liftie/Open-Meteo integrations are (see
 * providers/live/*), so none of these URLs could be fetch-verified to
 * actually resolve — they are real, indexed URLs from search results, never
 * invented, but a human with normal browser access should do a spot check
 * before leaning on this data for anything beyond display. Fields the
 * research could not confirm from an official (or, failing that, a clearly
 * reputable secondary) source are `null` rather than guessed.
 *
 * Opening/closing dates were researched in early September 2026, before the
 * 2026-27 season — most resorts had only a "target" date at that point, if
 * anything at all. Update this file as resorts confirm dates through the
 * season; nothing here should be treated as self-updating.
