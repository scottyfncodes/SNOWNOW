/**
 * The demo world.
 *
 * This module invents a plausible mid-season Colorado ski day for any date and
 * keeps it stable: the same date always produces the same world. It exists so
 * SNOWNOW can be evaluated end-to-end before any vendor API is wired up.
 *
 * Nothing here is real. Providers stamp every value with `source: 'demo'` and
 * the UI never renders demo numbers without saying so.
 *
 * The one rule the demo data has to obey is *causal differentiation*: the
 * mountain that wins has to win for a reason a skier would recognise. So each
 * mountain gets a distinct identity **and a distinct vulnerability**, and the
 * weather generator produces the conditions that expose them — big storms,
 * dry spells, wind events, warm afternoons, and storm tracks that favour one
 * part of the state over another.
